# CSE-6730-Modeling and Simulation  @ GaTech

Team members are: Cheting Meng, Hana Herndon, Xiyu Pan, Yuchen Wang, Zefang Chen.<br>

Our group conducts further research on traffic modeling and simulation, with a specific focus
on the impact of flooding on the roadway system. By employing numerical analysis, this study
uncover new understandings of the system’s behaviors during flooding, devise optimization insights, and
help increase the roadway system’s overall resilience.<br>
