# CSE6730-Project

This is the READMME for CSE6730 Project Team 14. Our team members are: Cheting Meng, Hana Herndon, 
Xiyu Pan, Yuchen Wang, Zefang Chen

Our group intends to conduct further research on traffic modeling and simulation, with a specific focus
on the impact of flooding on the roadway system. By employing numerical analysis, this study aims to
uncover new understandings of the system’s behaviors during flooding, devise optimization insights, and
help increase the roadway system’s overall resilience.
